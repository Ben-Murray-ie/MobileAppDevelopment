# MobileAppDevelopment

In this Mobile Application Development module, we used Typescript, Angular and Ionic framework to create a Hybrid mobile app. The app fetches a famous quote and the name of the quotee and presents it at the top of the screen. By default, the rest of the main page is blank. The user should go to the Settings page and input a country by its numeric code (found on the Reference page) and a range of ages in the appropriate fields. When the user leaves the Settings page, an API call to both sportdataapi.com and flagsapi.com is made. The page then shows the name of the selected country, the corresponding flag and a table containing the first and last name, height and age of all the players on that countries team, within the specified age range. The table can then be sorted by each column attribute.

**Note:**

Support for Sports Data API, used to access country/player data is no longer maintained. The demonstration below uses sample JSON data from the homepage, which is still accessible (31/07/23).
